/*
 * This file is not actually used, but instead exists so that the IDE this project is loaded in
 * doesn't obfuscate parent directory of this file. Not sure if the behavior is from Qt Creator
 * or CMake, but if all files that appear in a project file section (i.e. "Header Files") share
 * the same parent folder, that parent folder is hidden and all of the files of that inner folder are
 * simply shown as if they are at the root.
 *
 * This is annoying. At some point I'll look into getting this changed with whichever system is
 * responsible.
